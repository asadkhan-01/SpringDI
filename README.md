# SpringDI
In This Java Project I have created a small flow of Dependency Injection to understand how exactly IOC works with Beans(Spring).
How this works?
There is an Interface for Coach that has several Implementaions of Workout instructions
Then there is a dependent class that tells fortune<interface> which also has several implementaions
The main class is springHelloApp and spring config xml <applicationContext>
